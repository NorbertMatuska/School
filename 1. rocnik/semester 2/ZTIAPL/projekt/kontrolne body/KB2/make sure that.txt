Dear students,

For KB2 make sure to check following (unless you already did it properly in KB1):

* don't mix together classes, functions and attributes

* for attributes describe the expected ranges of values (a number can be any number or between 0 and 1.0)

* for attributes describe the meaning of possible values unless it is obvious ( `boolean isFacingLeft` is obvious, `boolean rotation` is not)

* describe what your functions do, unless it is obvious

* every object that must appear on the screen requires a function to draw it

* if an object must react to collisions, there must be a function to check for said collisions somewhere

* don't just write "there will be various power-ups", describe what exactly those power-ups do (enemy types, obstacles, etc.)
