                I have had my phone for three years now. Although
                "full-glass" casing sounds luxurious, in practice, the phone is slippery and that is
                why I had to buy a new case. 5,2" LTPS (TFT LCD) display with additional Full HD
                resolution. Within Battery manager, it is possible to active more battery-saving ROG
                mode, which through graphic chip sends image in 720 x 1280px. In settings on the other 
                hand, you can play with the temperature of colors. With readability under direct sun
                I had no problem, automatic adjustments to brightness will always take care of it. If a
                lot of direct light falls unto the sensor, brightness can automatically sets itself
                to even more than possible whit manual settings and that is why there's no problem even
                during a bright day. Honor 8 runs on Android 7.0 with a typical extension EMUI with a version
                of 5.0.1.For authorized unblocking you can use Fingerprint ID. It reacts instantly,
                without the need to turn on display. Fingerprint Id can also do a lot of other things and 
                you can set up some shortcuts, for example: One tap on Fingerprint ID can open some app, take
                a screenshot as well as double tap or hold. It can also swipe pictures in gallery, take photos
                as a trigger or even bring down the upper bar.<br>
                <br>
                Honor 8 can use DualSIM, but since I never used it, I really don't know how it works. 
                But the only thing I know is if you want to have a second SIM card, you will have to
                get rid of your microSD card becase there cannot be both of them.<br><br>
                
                On the back of the phone is located outstandingly practical infrared transmitter and
                with an app directly on your smartphone you can control your television, projector, A/C
                unit, DVD player, camera and so on .<br><br>
                
                You can activate your camera with a double-tap on your upper volume button and it will
                take a quick photo. On the main page of the camera application, Honor pulled up switching
                to video, switching to front and back camera, controlling the flash, effects and a system
                of double objectives. Manufacturer mentions, that both of these cameras use laser focus
                and one of the pair of 12mpx lenses (with aspect ratio 4:3) captures black and white
                images to get the biggest depth of field. In practice, you can use this to shoot close objects
                (within 2 meters from you), for example portraits or macro photos of flowers. Secondary
                lens can then take care of creating bokeh effect, meaning purposeful blurring of
                the background to bring out the details of an object in foreground. The intensity
                of this effect can be changed before or even after the image was take, but not always
                does it look good. Pro photo mode can offer to manual settings for ISO, balancing
                of white point, closing time with a maximal value of 30 seconds. But remember that
                Honor 8 doesn't have optical stabilization. Lens aperture number is f/2.2.
                Maximmum recording quality of a video is Full Hd with 60 frames per seconds. Even
                the front 8mpx camera is excellent, if you forget the beauty mode.<br><br>
                
                Reproduction of sound is taken care of with the bottom speaker with an average
                quality. You can connect your own headphones to a 3,5mm jack, because no headphones
                came with the package. Honor 8 got a 3000mAh battery with the support of fast charging
                thanks to the usb-c charger that came with it. Fully charging the smartphone takes about
                an hour and a half. With active using of the phone, it can last about a day without
                having to charge.<br><br>
                
                Conclusion - I have been using this smartphone for three years, and even if it's starting 
                to show on the exterier, and some applications can sometimes freeze or not respond,
                it is still a pretty stable mobile phone and I would have glady recommend it two years ago.
                These days you can get a better smartphone with the same price.<br><br>
