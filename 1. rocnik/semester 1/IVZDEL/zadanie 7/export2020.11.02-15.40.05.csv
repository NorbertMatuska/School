Although on the surface SDN provides a simple framework for network programmability and monitoring, few has been said about security measures to make it more robust to hitherto security flaws. Among the identified security flaws, DDoS flooding attack continue to be one of the major security concerns as attack volumes are increasing year on year. In this paper, we developed and implement the feasibility of spoofing and flooding DDoS attack on data plane devices using Mininet emulator, floodlight and network performance testing tools. We further developed a mitigation mechanism to counter these attacks by pushing reactive flow through the controller to the attacking switch port. Our result shows that pushing flows through the controller mitigates the flooding attack with low performance overheads, and requires no change to the controllers mode of operation for deployment, which indicates a good performance of our model.","","978-1-7281-2888-7","10.1109/FiCloud.2019.00019","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8972827","Software Defined Network, Mininet, Floodlight, Attack detection, Attack mitigation, Network security, DDoS","","computer network security;software defined networking;telecommunication traffic","greater control;network entities;control plane;surface SDN;network programmability;security measures;hitherto security flaws;identified security flaws;DDoS flooding attack;security concerns;attack volumes;spoofing;data plane devices;floodlight;network performance testing tools;reactive flow;attacking switch port;service attack detection;reactive countermeasure;software defined network;distributed denial of service attack detection","","","25","","30 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

DDoS attacks have become the most tedious and cumbersome issue in recent past. The number and magnitude of attacks have increased from few megabytes of data to 100s of terabytes of data these days. Due to the differences in the attack patterns or new types of attack, it is hard to detect these attacks effectively. In this paper, we devise new techniques for causing DDoS attacks and mitigation which are clearly shown to perform much better than the existing techniques. We also categorize DDoS attack techniques as well as the techniques used in their detection and thus attempt an extensive scoping of the DDoS problem.

A large number of these attacks aim to exhaust the network bandwidth of the server, and are called network layer DDoS attacks. They are volumetric attacks and rely on a large volume of network layer packets to throttle the bandwidth. However, as time passed, network infrastructure became more robust and defenses against network layer attacks also became more advanced. Recently, DDoS attacks have started targeting the application layer. Unlike network layer attacks, these attacks can be carried out with a relatively low attack volume. They also utilize legitimate application layer requests, which makes it difficult for existing defense mechanisms to detect them. These attacks target a wide variety of resources at the application layer and can bring a server down much faster, and with much more stealth, than network layer DDoS attacks. Over the past decade, research on application layer DDoS attacks has focused on a few classes of these attacks. This paper attempts to explore the entire spectrum of application layer DDoS attacks using critical features that aid in understanding how these attacks can be executed. defense mechanisms against the different classes of attacks are also discussed with special emphasis on the features that aid in the detection of different classes of attacks. Such a discussion is expected to help researchers understand why a particular group of features are useful in detecting a particular class of attacks.","1553-877X","","10.1109/COMST.2018.2870658","Ministry of Electronics and Information technology; Research and Development Project entitled “Development of Tool for Detection of Application Layer DDoS Attacks on Web Applications” during the period 2017–2019; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8466561","Application layer;DDoS;attacks;defenses;denial of service;taxonomy;detection;Web applications","Computer crime;Servers;Government;Bandwidth;Protocols;Feature extraction","computer network security;Internet","application layer DDoS attacks;devastating attacks;network layer DDoS attacks;network layer packets;relatively low attack volume;legitimate application layer requests","","11","121","","16 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Attackers send large number of requests to saturate a victim machine and it stops providing its services to legitimate users. In general attacks are directed to the network layer and the application layer, the latter has been increasing due mainly to its easy execution and difficult detection. The present work proposes a low cost detection approach that uses the characteristics of the Web User for the detection of attacks. To do this, the features are extracted in real time using functions designed in PHP and JavaScript. They are evaluated by an order 1 classifier to differentiate a real user from a DDoS attack. A real user is identified by making requests interacting with the computer system, while DDoS attacks are requests sent by robots to overload the system with indiscriminate requests. The tests were executed on a computer system using requests from real users and attacks using the LOIC, OWASP and GoldenEye tools. The results show that the proposed method has a detection efficiency of 100%, and that the characteristics of the web user allow to differentiate between a real user and a robot.","","978-1-5386-5384-5","10.1109/INFOCT.2018.8356848","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8356848","DDoS;denial of service;dynamism user;features user","Computer crime;Tools;Mice;Feature extraction;Real-time systems;Classification algorithms;CAPTCHAs","computer network security;Internet","computer system;detection efficiency;web user;DDoS attack detection mechanism;application layer;user features;attackers;network layer;low cost detection approach;computer aggressions;PHP;JavaScript;LOIC;OWASP;GoldenEye tools","","1","12","","10 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Because of the characteristic of fast overwhelming, it is important to make fast as well as accurate response to DDoS attacks, and the real-time performance can be even more important to prevent and legitimate the attacks. Among the methods proposed by researchers, the entropy-based detection method provides a sensitive and reliable performance. However, the balance between computational complexity and recognition accuracy remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a detection method that consists of 3 main parts in different aspects: a sliding time window to fasten the entropy calculation, a single-directional filter to realize early detection during the DDoS progress but not after the crash, and a quintile deviation check algorithm to optimize the detection result. These will eventually lead to a real-time and high-efficient performance to recognize IoT DDoS attacks as soon as possible.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2974293","Shanghai Jiao Tong University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9000545","DDoS detection;IoT security;joint entropy;quintile deviation check;real-time detection;sliding time window","Computer crime;Denial-of-service attack;Entropy;Real-time systems;IP networks;Microsoft Windows;Internet of Things","communication complexity;computer network security;entropy;Internet of Things","quintile deviation check algorithm;single-directional filter;computational complexity;entropy-based detection method;Internet-of-Things devices;cyberspace;distributed denial of service attacks;real-time volumetric detection scheme;RTVD;IoT DDoS attacks;entropy calculation;sliding time window","","2","40","CCBY","17 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we show a test-bed that we have developed to detect vulnerabilities within SCADA protocols against internal attacks in order to find out how easy it is to bypass security measures in such protocols. Furthermore, we have tested SCADA components to assess their vulnerabilities against the following attacks: Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, replay attacks, cryptographic attacks, and fragmentation attacks.

In this regard, firstly, an online systemic management scheme is developed to guarantee the supply of the requested power from the stack with the highest efficiency. This scheme is based on an updatable 3D map which relates the requested power from the stack to its optimal temperature and current. Secondly, two different EMSs are used to distribute the power between the FCS and battery. The EMSs' constraints are constantly updated by the online model to embrace the stack performance drifts owing to degradation and operating conditions variation. Finally, the effect of integrating the developed online systemic management into the EMSs' design is experimentally scrutinized under two standard driving cycles and indicated that up to 3.7% efficiency enhancement can be reached by employing such a systemic approach.

So, one must find an efficient way to reduce the size of data from dataset without losing important and relevant information. In this paper we proposed a feature selection for effective Intrusion Detection System. The proposed system performs feature selection. In this paper, we proposed a performance based feature selection process with machine learning for most relevant features selection. We used JRip rule based classification algorithm for performance evaluation using 10-fold cross validation. This study is performed using a new labeled flow based CICIDS2017 data set.

Reducing capital and operational expenditure to a great extent already drew attention of big companies and industries. Not only startups but also large existing giant companies are shifting their data from local server to a public cloud and sometimes even taking the initiative to build a public cloud to host their sensitive data. A cloud can provide storage services, computing services and also infrastructure without any capital or operational expenses. From a single user to a multi-national million-dollar business can easily receive several types of services from a public cloud. There are numerous cloud providers in the market. Among the prominent ones, few names are mentioned here, such as Amazon AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure etc. GCP offers a wide array of services for many organizations and individuals around the world like other cloud providers. But the question is, all those data, confidential information, intellectual property of individual or industries safe enough? Information has become the most expensive commodity in modern days. A government can be shutdown, a transport system can be disabled, annoying spam calls, phishing emails, cyber bullying and more security threats are existing around us. Can we trust a public service provider? Hence our initiative aims at investigating that GCP is secure from inside attackers. Why we chose inside attackers? Well the idea is to check if GCP can detect and ignore an attack launched internally. In this case it should be secure enough to prevent from outsiders as well. The research investigation would involve Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks against a local virtual machine (VM) launched from GCP.

This paper presents a model-based adaptive architecture and algorithm for detecting DoS attacks at the web application level and mitigating them. Using a performance model to predict the impact of arriving requests, a decision engine adaptively generates rules for filtering traffic and sending suspicious traffic for further review, which may ultimately result in dropping the request or presenting the end user with a CAPTCHA to verify they are a legitimate user.

However, very often, different new attacks are most successful in breaching these detection techniques. This very reason has been a motivation for us to explore the biological aspects and its defense mechanisms for designing a secure network model. After much study, we have identified that plants have a very well-established and evolved detection and a response mechanism to pathogens. In this paper, we have proposed and implemented a network attack detection and a response model inspired by plants. It is a three-layered model in analogy to the three-layer defense mechanism of plants to pathogens. We have further tested the proposed model to different network attacks and have compared the results to the open-source intrusion detection system, Snort.

The proposed research involves an optimized SVM classification algorithm integrated with SNORT IPS to provide prevention mechanisms for the entire network when subject to DDoS attack. The proposed IPS method allows traffic identified as legitimate to pass through the network, whereas suspect traffic is flagged and has to go through an identification system.

As Ontology describes the semantic relations between entities, we used this technique in our system to describe the attacks by their behavior. Our proposed Intrusion Detection System contains multiple agents like Sniffer agent, Analysis Agent, communication agent and manager agent. They work collectively to detect the intrusion in a much efficient way. Analysis agent uses ontology to identify the attack. Protege is software which creates ontology. Our system semantically analyses various fields of the packet and infer to a solution about attack. To identify complex attacks occurs in distributed environment that are not identified by the existing systems we are using complex attack ontology.

As one of the important assets, LPSE must be protected to ensure continuity of services as well as to minimize the risk of service interruption. With the increase of sophisticated information systems and technology, the threat will also become more sophisticated. DDoS attacks are one of the most threat to the government procurement service. In this paper, we evaluated the impact of DDoS attacks on the existing network infrastructure of government procurement service and also evaluates the existing network defense mechanisms such firewall router and web server. We also compared the implementation of Intrusion Detection system, firewall server based and honeypot in the network to mitigate DDoS Attacks. During UDP Flood the results showed that on the existing network infrastructure, CPU usage of integrated firewall reaching 100 % and at 500 requests to the LPSE web server, there were only 30 requests that could be processed.

Inspired by the success of machine learning in a variety of fields and domain applications, numerous intelligent schemes have been proposed to effectively defend against and mitigate the impact of these attacks. Traditional machine learning methods, however, are limited by the use of an expensive and error-prone feature engineering process. Feature engineering is fundamental to the application of machine learning, and is both difficult and expensive. Furthermore, the ability of these schemes to successfully detect previously unknown attacks is limited. To address these limitations, a novel DDoS detection scheme, based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), is proposed. The basic tenet of the LSTM scheme is its ability to distinguish between attack and legitimate flows by only examining a relatively small number of a network flow packets. The performance evaluation results show that the LSTM-based scheme successfully learns the complex flow-level feature representations embedded in raw input traffic. Furthermore, the results show that the scheme performs better than other approaches that use sophisticated flow-level statistical features. Lastly, the results show the ability of the proposed scheme to accurately capture the dynamic behaviors of unknown network traffic exceeds that of traditional machine learning methods.","2576-6813","978-1-7281-0962-6","10.1109/GLOBECOM38437.2019.9013450","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9013450","","Computer crime;Machine learning;Feature extraction;Botnet;Training;Recurrent neural networks;Intrusion detection","","","","2","25","","27 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Studies have shown that an SDN may experience a high packet loss rate and a long delay in forwarding messages when the OpenFlow channel is overwhelmed by a saturation attack. The existing approaches have focused on the detection of saturation attacks caused by TCP-SYN flooding through periodic analysis of network traffic. However, there are two issues. First, previous approaches are incapable of detecting other types, especially unknown types, of saturation attacks. Second, they rely on predetermined time-window of network traffic and thus are unable to determine what time window of traffic data would be appropriate for effective attack detection. To tackle these problems, this paper first investigates the impact of different time-windows of OpenFlow traffic on the detection performance of three classification algorithms: the Support Vector Machine (SVM), the Naïve Bayes (NB) classifier, and the K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) classifier. We have built and analyzed a total of 150 models on OpenFlow traffic datasets generated from both physical and simulated SDN environments. The experiment results show that the chosen time-interval of OpenFlow traffic heavily influences the detection performance - larger time-windows may result in decreased detection performance. In addition, we were able to achieve reasonable accuracy on detection of unknown attacks by applying proper time-windows of OpenFlow traffic.","","978-1-7281-0875-9","10.1109/CCCS.2019.8888049","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8888049","Software-defined networking;OpenFlow;saturation attack;anomaly detection;machine learning","Floods;Computer crime;Support vector machines;Machine learning;Training;Telecommunication traffic;Control systems","computer network management;computer network security;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;software defined networking;support vector machines;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","data plane;high packet loss rate;saturation attack;network traffic;predetermined time-window;effective attack detection;OpenFlow traffic datasets;physical SDN environments;simulated SDN environments;detection performance;Software Defined Networking;network paradigm;network management;support vector machine;SVM;Naïve Bayes classifier;K-Nearest Neighbors classifier;machine learning","","2","27","","31 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

DDoS flooding attacks are typically explicit attempts to disrupt legitimate users' access to services. Attackers usually gain access to a large number of computers by exploiting their vulnerabilities to set up attack armies (i.e., Botnets). Once an attack army has been set up, an attacker can invoke a coordinated, large-scale attack against one or more targets. Developing a comprehensive defense mechanism against identified and anticipated DDoS flooding attacks is a desired goal of the intrusion detection and prevention research community. However, the development of such a mechanism requires a comprehensive understanding of the problem and the techniques that have been used thus far in preventing, detecting, and responding to various DDoS flooding attacks. In this paper, we explore the scope of the DDoS flooding attack problem and attempts to combat it. We categorize the DDoS flooding attacks and classify existing countermeasures based on where and when they prevent, detect, and respond to the DDoS flooding attacks. Moreover, we highlight the need for a comprehensive distributed and collaborative defense approach. Our primary intention for this work is to stimulate the research community into developing creative, effective, efficient, and comprehensive prevention, detection, and response mechanisms that address the DDoS flooding problem before, during and after an actual attack.","1553-877X","","10.1109/SURV.2013.031413.00127","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6489876","Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) flooding attack;intrusion detection systems;intrusion prevention systems;distributed DDoS defense;collaborative DDoS defense","Intrusion detection;Denial of service;Network service","computer network security","comprehensive distributed defense approach;collaborative defense approach;DDoS flooding attack problem;prevention research community;intrusion detection;comprehensive defense mechanism;coordinated large-scale attack;distributed denial of service flooding attacks","","508","149","","28 Mar 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We make four main contributions; (1) an innovative application of a CNN to detect DDoS traffic with low processing overhead, (2) a dataset-agnostic preprocessing mechanism to produce traffic observations for online attack detection, (3) an activation analysis to explain Lucid's DDoS classification, and (4) an empirical validation of the solution on a resource-constrained hardware platform.

There is a need then for an IDS method with machine learning (ML) that is more accurate in detecting attacks. Several previous studies have known that the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Decision Tree (DT) algorithms are two algorithms with high accuracy in detecting DDoS attacks.

Commercial and government Web servers have become the primary target of these kinds of attacks, with the recent mitigation efforts struggling to deaden the problem efficiently. Most application layer DDoS attacks can successfully mimic legitimate traffic without being detected by Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS). IDSs and IPSs can also mistake a normal and legitimate activity for a malicious one, producing a False Positive (FP) that affects Web users if it is ignored or dropped. False positives in a large and complex network topology can potentially be dangerous as they may cause IDS/IPS to block the user's benign traffic. Our focus and contributions in this paper are first, to mitigate the undetected malicious traffic mimicking legitimate traffic and developing a special anti-DDoS module for general and specific DDoS tools attacks by using a trained classifier in a random tree machine-learning algorithm. We use labeled datasets to generate rules to incorporate and fine-tune existing IDS/IPS such as Snort. Secondly, we further assist IDS/IPS by processing traffic that is classified as malicious by the IDS/IPS in order to identify FPs and route them to their intended destinations. To achieve this, our approach uses active authentication of traffic source of both legitimate and malicious traffic at the Bait and Decoy server respectively before destined to the Web server.","0730-3157","978-1-4673-6564-2","10.1109/COMPSAC.2015.240","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7273365","DDoS Mitigation;Machine Learning;Java Script;False Positives;IDS/IPS","Web servers;Computer crime;Training;Authentication;Logic gates","computer network security;file servers;Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;telecommunication traffic","Web server protection;application layer DDoS attacks;traffic authentication;distributed denial of service;destination servers;minimal computational resources;government Web servers;mitigation efforts;intrusion detection systems;IDS;intrusion prevention systems;IPS;false positive;FP;Web users;trained classifier;random tree machine-learning algorithm;traffic source active authentication;bait-and-decoy server;legitimate traffic;malicious traffic","","12","13","","24 Sep 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The first defense line focuses on making decisions about abnormal network conditions by the minimum risk machine learning algorithms. The second defense line is the encryption strategy which focuses on the intent and application. The programmable devices implement novel policies such as multipath transmission and packet encapsulation. LANIM inherits the existing countermeasures based on computational complexity, which is the third defense line. Besides, the policy dynamically updates with random seeds is the constraint of the cyberattack. The attackers have to conquer these three immune lines before the new policy update otherwise the offensive is shattered.

In this article, we propose a novel approach to mitigate DDoS attacks using an intelligent fast-flux swarm network. An intelligent swarm network is required to ensure autonomous coordination and allocation of swarm nodes to perform its relaying operations. We adapted the Intelligent Water Drop algorithm for distributed and parallel optimization. The fast-flux technique was used to maintain connectivity between swarm nodes, clients, and servers. Fast-flux service networks also allow us to build a transparent service, which allows minimal modifications of existing cloud services (e.g. HTTP, SMTP). A software simulation consisting of 400,000 client nodes and 10,000 swarm nodes has shown that we can maintain 99.96 percent packet delivery ratio when the network is under attack from a similarly sized DDoS network of 10,000 dedicated malicious nodes.","1558-156X","","10.1109/MNET.2011.5958005","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5958005","","Peer to peer computing;Particle swarm optimization;Computer crime;Cloud computing;Relays;Computer security","cloud computing;optimisation;security of data","DDoS attack mitigation;intelligent fast-flux swarm network;transparent fast-flux swarm network;cloud computing;intelligent water drop algorithm;distributed optimization;parallel optimization;fast-flux service networks;software simulation;client nodes;swarm nodes","","28","10","","18 Jul 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Recent studies have shown that there exist various security threats in SDN. For example, a saturation attack may disturb the normal delivery of packets and even make the SDN system out of service by flooding the data plane, the control plane, or both. The existing research has focused on saturation attacks caused by SYN flooding. This paper presents an anomaly detection method, called SA-Detector, for dealing with a family of saturation attacks through IP spoofing, ICMP flooding, UDP flooding, and other types of TCP flooding, in addition to SYN flooding. SA-Detector builds upon the study of self-similarity characteristics of OpenFlow traffic between the control and data planes. Our work has shown that the normal and abnormal traffic flows through the OpenFlow communication channel have different statistical properties. Specifically, normal OpenFlow traffic has a low self-similarity degree whereas the occurrences of saturation attacks typically imply a higher degree of self-similarity. Therefore, SA-Detector exploits statistical results and self-similarity degrees of OpenFlow traffic, measured by Hurst exponents, for anomaly detection. We have evaluated our approach in both physical and simulation SDN environments with various time intervals, network topologies and applications, Internet protocols, and traffic generation tools. For the physical SDN environment, the average accuracy of detection is 97.68% and the average precision is 94.67%. For the simulation environment, the average accuracy is 96.54% and the average precision is 92.06%. In addition, we have compared SA-Detector with the existing saturation attack detection methods in terms of the aforementioned performance metrics and controller's CPU utilization. The experiment results indicate that SA-Detector is effective for the detection of saturation attacks in SDN.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2019.2959268","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8932535","Software-defined networking;security;saturation attack;anomaly detection;self-similar characteristic of OpenFlow traffic","Control systems;Anomaly detection;Protocols;Monitoring;Intrusion detection;Network topology","computer network security;software defined networking;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","normal OpenFlow traffic;SA-Detector;SDN environments;control plane;data plane;SYN flooding;ICMP flooding;UDP flooding;TCP flooding;abnormal traffic;saturation attack detection methods;Hurst exponents;self-similarity degrees;traffic generation tools","","2","31","IEEE","13 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Depending on the nature of the learning, machine‐learning algorithms can be categorized as: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. The chapter summarizes the machine‐learning algorithms that could be used for various use cases for different domains. There are multiple issues with a cloud‐only architecture where data from IoT devices make it to the cloud to be processed and analyzed.

Cloud computing is considered to be the most crucial computing paradigm for on-demand services, pay-as-you-go model, storage and processing of data/information. Existing security mechanism has failed in multiple aspects. This paper introduces a naïve defense mechanism named as FilterFog. This FilterFog has been implemented to serve two important criteria. The first criterion sums up the reason why fog computing firstly came into the picture i.e. as an extension of the cloud. The fog computing basically provides the cloud services at the network's edge granting proximity. The second criterion is fog computing acting as a defense mechanism for cloud against DDoS attack. Here it uses some script files and some IP table forwarding rules to filter the traffic. This paper is a naive attempt at using fog as FilterFog.","","978-1-5386-4430-0","10.1109/ICCCNT.2018.8493704","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8493704","Cloud computing;Fog Computing;DDoS attack;TCP SYN flooding attack;UDP Storm flooding attack","Computer crime;Cloud computing;Floods;Servers;Storms;Information filtering","cloud computing;computer network security;data privacy;telecommunication traffic","DDoS detection;defence mechanism;privacy measures;cloud computing;on-demand services;security mechanism;naïve defense mechanism;FilterFog;fog computing;cloud services;DDoS attack;DDoS mitigation;FogFilter;security measures;pay-as-you-go model","","2","14","","18 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Along with raising the number of novel attacks, many types of countermeasures have taken place to stop them. One of the most efficient methods to stop network attacks is using IDS/IPS Systems. The ultimate goal of an IDPS system is to stop security attacks before they have been carried successfully. This paper proposed an efficient network-based IDPS System which takes multiple counteractions against network attacks. The proposed system's first reaction after detecting malicious packets is to generate an alert and log them; if the number of packets goes beyond threshold limit in one second, the second counteraction takes place to block the attackers IP address through firewall. Finally, if the system fails to block these packets, the third counteraction takes place to remotely stop the corresponding service. In this case the system prevents an attack from being successfully carried.","","978-1-5090-3294-5","10.1109/ICIIECS.2017.8276023","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8276023","IDS;IPS system;Network security;Network attack prevention;Intrusion Prevention System;NIDPS","IP networks;Databases;Firewalls (computing);Ports (Computers);Web servers","firewalls;Internet;IP networks","firewall;network-based IDPS system;network-based intrusion detection;information security;ultimate goal;IDS/IPS Systems;mobile systems;multimode counteractions;prevention system;attackers IP address;counteraction;malicious packets;network attacks;multiple counteractions;security attacks","","","18","","1 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many traditional detection methods fail due to their limitations in real-time, complexity or universality. Therefore, it is necessary to explore how to timely detect different kinds of DDOS by utilizing simple traffic sampling data such as NetFlow in high speed networks up to Tbps bandwidth. In this paper, we put forward a scheme to identify DDos traffic with NetFlow feature selection and machine learning. Firstly, we extract adaptive flow-based features and pattern-based features from sampling NetFlow data in real-time. Then we build a detector by RandomForest and evaluate it by using a research lab network trace which contains benign traffic and simulated DDos traffic of different kinds by popular DDos tools. Experiment results show that our method achieves an average accuracy of more than 99% and a false-positive less than 0.5%. Besides, our method is valid for DDos means such as stealthy DDos attack so it is more universal that typical traditional methods. Finally, we apply our detector on the real-world NetFlow logs provided by a large ISP, and measure the characteristics of DDos in several dimensions. This also proves that our detector is applicable for real-world network.","2155-7586","978-1-5386-7185-6","10.1109/MILCOM.2018.8599738","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8599738","DDos classification;NetFlow;Machine Learning","Computer crime;Feature extraction;Tools;Detectors;Machine learning;Real-time systems;Data mining","computer network security;feature extraction;feature selection;Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);sampling methods;telecommunication traffic","NetFlow feature selection;NetFlow data;research lab network trace;DDos traffic;real-world NetFlow;DDos detection;NetFlow analysis;high speed networks;distributed denial of service;machine learning;Internet;traffic sampling data;pattern-based feature extraction;adaptive flow-based feature extraction;random forest;DDos attack","","3","16","","3 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Data security is the main concern in cloud computing because it is stored in data centers provided by service providers. DDoS attacks are rapidly growing in the cloud environment and have become a serious threat to cloud consumers. SDN is used to identify and prevent DDoS attacks in the cloud and it simplifies network complexity. In this paper, we have proposed a method that detects and mitigates DDoS attacks in cloud computing using the features of SDN with high accuracy and low computational cost. The proposed system is able to block the illegitimate users and allow only legitimate users to access the cloud services.

For some sectors, like industry, smart grids, transportation, and medical services, the significance of such attacks is obvious, since IoT technologies are part of critical back-end systems. However, in sectors where IoT is usually at the end-user side, like smart homes, such attacks can be underestimated, since not all possible attack paths are examined. In this paper, we survey IoT-enabled cyber attacks, found in all application domains since 2010. For each sector, we emphasize on the latest, verified IoT-enabled attacks, based on known real-world incidents and published proof-of-concept attacks. We methodologically analyze representative attacks that demonstrate direct, indirect, and subliminal attack paths against critical targets. Our goal is threefold: 1) to assess IoT-enabled cyber attacks in a risk-like approach, in order to demonstrate their current threat landscape; 2) to identify hidden and subliminal IoT-enabled attack paths against critical infrastructures and services; and 3) to examine mitigation strategies for all application domains.","1553-877X","","10.1109/COMST.2018.2855563","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8410404","Internet of Things;cyber attacks;smart grids;SCADA;intelligent transportation systems;smart medical systems;smart home;critical infrastructures","SCADA;Cyberattack;Internet of Things;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks;Critical infrastructure;Smart grids;Smart homes","critical infrastructures;Internet of Things;security of data","IoT technologies;IoT-enabled cyberattacks;services;critical infrastructures;proof-of-concept attacks;critical back-end systems","","31","262","","12 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The instructor demonstrated the methods and tools before the experiments. Students were separated in two groups, group A and group B. At first, group A acted as the red team (attackers) and group B played the blue team (defenders). The following week group roles were exchanged. The instructor had a multiple role. During the preparation phase he acted as a teacher building the necessary background, designing, modifying and applying the educational scenario. During the execution phase he acted as coach and motivator offering advice and technical support; he also acted as a researcher, observing student participation, decision-making and initiatives, in order to assess the scenario as well as the students.

Hybrid IP traceback schemes outdo discrete marking and logging approaches and trace the source of attack using a few packets. The findings of this research redound to current single-packet hybrid IP traceback schemes by employing the double hashing technique to resolve collisions in the hash table and thus reducing the logging time at routers by 15%. Besides, the proposed scheme ensures zero false positives by encoding the options field in IPv4 header. The research also introduces the first single-packet hybrid IP traceback implementation for IPv6 networks using hop-by-hop extension header. The simulation results correctly demonstrate the viability of the proposed scheme and unveil that IPv6 implementation requires 82.5% less storage in contrast to existing work.","1751-8717","","10.1049/iet-ifs.2015.0483","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8277195","","","computer network security;IP networks","hop-by-hop extension header;IPv4 header;zero false positives;logging time;hash table;double hashing technique;attack sources;distributed denial-of-service attack;IPv4 networks;IPv6 networks;single-packet hybrid IP traceback","","2","27","","1 Feb 2018","","","IET","IET Journals"

In this paper, we present a survey on darknet. The latter is an effective approach to observe Internet activities and cyber attacks via passive monitoring. We primarily define and characterize darknet and indicate its alternative names. We further list other trap-based monitoring systems and compare them to darknet. Moreover, in order to provide realistic measures and analysis of darknet information, we report case studies, namely, Conficker worm in 2008 and 2009, Sality SIP scan botnet in 2011, and the largest amplification attack in 2014. Finally, we provide a taxonomy in relation to darknet technologies and identify research gaps that are related to three main darknet categories: deployment, traffic analysis, and visualization. Darknet projects are found to monitor various cyber threat activities and are distributed in one third of the global Internet. We further identify that Honeyd is probably the most practical tool to implement darknet sensors, and future deployment of darknet will include mobile-based VOIP technology. In addition, as far as darknet analysis is considered, computer worms and scanning activities are found to be the most common threats that can be investigated throughout darknet; Code Red and Slammer/Sapphire are the most analyzed worms. Furthermore, our study uncovers various lacks in darknet research. For instance, less than 1% of the contributions tackled distributed reflection denial of service (DRDoS) amplification investigations, and at most 2% of research works pinpointed spoofing activities. Last but not least, our survey identifies specific darknet areas, such as IPv6 darknet, event monitoring, and game engine visualization methods that require a significantly greater amount of attention from the research community.","1553-877X","","10.1109/COMST.2015.2497690","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7317717","Cyber;Darknet;Threats;Security;Intelligence;Cyber Attacks;Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS);Distributed Reflection Denial of Service (DRDoS);Botnet;Worms;Probing;Cyber;darknet;threats;security;intelligence;cyber attacks;distributed denial of service (DDoS);distributed reflection denial of service (DRDoS);botnet;worms;probing","Monitoring;IP networks;Internet;Sensors;Taxonomy;Computer crime","computer network security;Internet;invasive software;IP networks","Internet security community;cyberspace monitoring;cyber intelligence;Internet activities;cyber attacks;passive monitoring;trap-based monitoring systems;Conficker worm;Sality SIP scan botnet;largest amplification attack;taxonomy;darknet projects;cyber threat activities;Honeyd;darknet sensors;mobile-based VOIP technology;computer worms;scanning activities;distributed reflection denial of service amplification investigations;DRDoS amplification investigations;spoofing activities;IPv6 darknet;event monitoring;game engine visualization methods","","41","231","","4 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, despite the promising reported results, it is hardly deployed to real world environments. The main challenge in its adoption is the discrepancy between the accuracy rates obtained during the classifier development process and the rates obtained during its use in production environments. Such a discrepancy is mainly caused by non-representative training databases and nongeneralizable (scenario-specific) classifier's model. This paper presents a method to create intrusion databases, which aims at mimicking the production environments characteristics by using well-known tools. Moreover, we present and evaluate a new validation technique, which aims at ensuring the generalization capacity of the obtained models, reached using cross-validating with different intrusion databases. The evaluation tests showed the feasibility of the proposed method. The feature selection technique ensured the model generalization capacity, improving its accuracy rate by 13%, while testing in different intrusion databases. Finally, the proposed anomaly-based approach was compared with Snort, reaching an accuracy rate of 99% against 27% of Snort for detecting DoS attacks.","1530-1346","978-1-5386-6950-1","10.1109/ISCC.2018.8538524","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8538524","Anomaly-based Intrusion Detection;Model Generalization;Machine Learning;Genetic Algorithm","Computers;Protocols;Computational modeling;Databases;Feature extraction;Standards;Intrusion detection","computer network security;database management systems;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","machine learning techniques;classifier development process;nonrepresentative training databases;validation technique;feature selection technique;model generalization capacity;intrusion databases;anomaly-based intrusion detection;production environment characteristics","","","22","","18 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Augenstein",University of Sheffield; University of Sheffield; University College London,"Natural Language Processing for the Semantic Web","","2016","","","","","This book introduces core natural language processing (NLP) technologies to non-experts in an easily accessible way, as a series of building blocks that lead the user to understand key technologies, why they are required, and how to integrate them into Semantic Web applications. Natural language processing and Semantic Web technologies have different, but complementary roles in data management. Combining these two technologies enables structured and unstructured data to merge seamlessly. Semantic Web technologies aim to convert unstructured data to meaningful representations, which benefit enormously from the use of NLP technologies, thereby enabling applications such as connecting text to Linked Open Data, connecting texts to each other, semantic searching, information visualization, and modeling of user behavior in online networks.  The first half of this book describes the basic NLP processing tools: tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and morphological analysis, in addition to the main tools required for an information extraction system (named entity recognition and relation extraction) which build on these components. The second half of the book explains how Semantic Web and NLP technologies can enhance each other, for example via semantic annotation, ontology linking, and population. These chapters also discuss sentiment analysis, a key component in making sense of textual data, and the difficulties of performing NLP on social media, as well as some proposed solutions. The book finishes by investigating some applications of these tools, focusing on semantic search and visualization, modeling user behavior, and an outlook on the future.

A non-self entity (malicious), once identified, is attacked by particular types of cells to remove the intruder before it can cause damage. Our immune system has components that identify not only non-self entities but also recall old entities that may not have been encountered for a very long time, but it is still essential that these entities be correctly classified as malicious. The domain of cybersecurity can significantly benefit from having a framework that can identify, react and adapt to malicious behaviors. Such a model for cyber protection should draw a parallel to our immune system, at least at a high level. In this work, we present a flexible framework that leverages machine learning to identify malicious behaviors that are threats to users, computers, and applications in a network. The proposed framework relies on the collection and aggregation of information relevant to identifying such malicious behaviors, machine learning - to learn and identify non-self behaviors automatically, and an adaptation mechanism to incorporate new threats for future classification. We benchmarked the proposed approach on a data set collected from multiple users, computer and applications, and we show that attacks (i.e., non-self behaviors) can be identified and mitigated through software. We compared classification models that perform binary classification (i.e., self or non-self), as well as multi-class predictions (i.e., what type of non-self behavior is detected).","","978-1-5386-1939-1","10.1109/ICCAC.2017.13","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8064054","","Computers;Computational modeling;Immune system;Monitoring;Databases;Numerical models;Analytical models","artificial immune systems;error correction codes;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;security of data","machine learning;malicious behaviors;nonself behavior;self-protection agent;error correcting output codes;human immune system;nonself entity;old entities;cyber protection;flexible framework;cybersecurity;classification models;binary classification","","","37","","12 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The enormous potential of IoT systems enables each and every device to communicate with each other, thereby providing more productivity. In this scenario, heterogeneity of technologies in use is expected to intensify the security threats. Policy enforcement for the assurance of privacy and security plays a key role in these systems. Fulfillment of privacy and security related requirements include confidentiality of data, user and device authentication, access control, and trust assurance among the things. However, recent reported events related to security attacks show colossal vulnerabilities among IoT devices capable of bringing security risks to the whole environment. One of the common uses of these devices by the attackers is to generate powerful distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. It is one of the most prominent attacking behaviors over a network by a group of geographically distributed zombie computers that interrupt and block legitimate users to use the network resources and hence, requires great attention. In this regard, the current work being novel in the field puts concentration on variants of DDoS attacks and their impact on IoT networks along with some of the existing countermeasures to defend against these attacks. The paper also discusses the detailed working mechanism of these attacks and highlights some of the commonly used tools that are deployed in such attack scenarios.","2509-3312","","10.1007/s41650-018-0022-5","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8932306","Internet of things;distributed denial of service attack;security;Mirai;botnet","","","","","2","","","6 Feb 2020","","","PTP","PTP Journals"
