Although on the surface SDN provides a simple framework for network programmability and monitoring, few has been said about security measures to make it more robust to hitherto security flaws. Among the identified security flaws, DDoS flooding attack continue to be one of the major security concerns as attack volumes are increasing year on year. In this paper, we developed and implement the feasibility of spoofing and flooding DDoS attack on data plane devices using Mininet emulator, floodlight and network performance testing tools. We further developed a mitigation mechanism to counter these attacks by pushing reactive flow through the controller to the attacking switch port. Our result shows that pushing flows through the controller mitigates the flooding attack with low performance overheads, and requires no change to the controllers mode of operation for deployment, which indicates a good performance of our model.","","978-1-7281-2888-7","10.1109/FiCloud.2019.00019","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8972827","Software Defined Network, Mininet, Floodlight, Attack detection, Attack mitigation, Network security, DDoS","","computer network security;software defined networking;telecommunication traffic","greater control;network entities;control plane;surface SDN;network programmability;security measures;hitherto security flaws;identified security flaws;DDoS flooding attack;security concerns;attack volumes;spoofing;data plane devices;floodlight;network performance testing tools;reactive flow;attacking switch port;service attack detection;reactive countermeasure;software defined network;distributed denial of service attack detection","","","25","","30 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A large number of these attacks aim to exhaust the network bandwidth of the server, and are called network layer DDoS attacks. They are volumetric attacks and rely on a large volume of network layer packets to throttle the bandwidth. However, as time passed, network infrastructure became more robust and defenses against network layer attacks also became more advanced. Recently, DDoS attacks have started targeting the application layer. Unlike network layer attacks, these attacks can be carried out with a relatively low attack volume. They also utilize legitimate application layer requests, which makes it difficult for existing defense mechanisms to detect them. These attacks target a wide variety of resources at the application layer and can bring a server down much faster, and with much more stealth, than network layer DDoS attacks. Over the past decade, research on application layer DDoS attacks has focused on a few classes of these attacks. This paper attempts to explore the entire spectrum of application layer DDoS attacks using critical features that aid in understanding how these attacks can be executed. defense mechanisms against the different classes of attacks are also discussed with special emphasis on the features that aid in the detection of different classes of attacks. Such a discussion is expected to help researchers understand why a particular group of features are useful in detecting a particular class of attacks.","1553-877X","","10.1109/COMST.2018.2870658","Ministry of Electronics and Information technology; Research and Development Project entitled “Development of Tool for Detection of Application Layer DDoS Attacks on Web Applications” during the period 2017–2019; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8466561","Application layer;DDoS;attacks;defenses;denial of service;taxonomy;detection;Web applications","Computer crime;Servers;Government;Bandwidth;Protocols;Feature extraction","computer network security;Internet","application layer DDoS attacks;devastating attacks;network layer DDoS attacks;network layer packets;relatively low attack volume;legitimate application layer requests","","11","121","","16 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The attackers can now easily launch a bigger and more challenging DDoS attack both towards and with Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, due to the fast popularization of them. Because of the characteristic of fast overwhelming, it is important to make fast as well as accurate response to DDoS attacks, and the real-time performance can be even more important to prevent and legitimate the attacks. Among the methods proposed by researchers, the entropy-based detection method provides a sensitive and reliable performance. However, the balance between computational complexity and recognition accuracy remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a detection method that consists of 3 main parts in different aspects: a sliding time window to fasten the entropy calculation, a single-directional filter to realize early detection during the DDoS progress but not after the crash, and a quintile deviation check algorithm to optimize the detection result. These will eventually lead to a real-time and high-efficient performance to recognize IoT DDoS attacks as soon as possible.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2974293","Shanghai Jiao Tong University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9000545","DDoS detection;IoT security;joint entropy;quintile deviation check;real-time detection;sliding time window","Computer crime;Denial-of-service attack;Entropy;Real-time systems;IP networks;Microsoft Windows;Internet of Things","communication complexity;computer network security;entropy;Internet of Things","quintile deviation check algorithm;single-directional filter;computational complexity;entropy-based detection method;Internet-of-Things devices;cyberspace;distributed denial of service attacks;real-time volumetric detection scheme;RTVD;IoT DDoS attacks;entropy calculation;sliding time window","","2","40","CCBY","17 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this regard, firstly, an online systemic management scheme is developed to guarantee the supply of the requested power from the stack with the highest efficiency. This scheme is based on an updatable 3D map which relates the requested power from the stack to its optimal temperature and current. Secondly, two different EMSs are used to distribute the power between the FCS and battery. The EMSs' constraints are constantly updated by the online model to embrace the stack performance drifts owing to degradation and operating conditions variation. Finally, the effect of integrating the developed online systemic management into the EMSs' design is experimentally scrutinized under two standard driving cycles and indicated that up to 3.7% efficiency enhancement can be reached by employing such a systemic approach.

Reducing capital and operational expenditure to a great extent already drew attention of big companies and industries. Not only startups but also large existing giant companies are shifting their data from local server to a public cloud and sometimes even taking the initiative to build a public cloud to host their sensitive data. A cloud can provide storage services, computing services and also infrastructure without any capital or operational expenses. From a single user to a multi-national million-dollar business can easily receive several types of services from a public cloud. There are numerous cloud providers in the market. Among the prominent ones, few names are mentioned here, such as Amazon AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure etc. GCP offers a wide array of services for many organizations and individuals around the world like other cloud providers. But the question is, all those data, confidential information, intellectual property of individual or industries safe enough? Information has become the most expensive commodity in modern days. A government can be shutdown, a transport system can be disabled, annoying spam calls, phishing emails, cyber bullying and more security threats are existing around us. Can we trust a public service provider? Hence our initiative aims at investigating that GCP is secure from inside attackers. Why we chose inside attackers? Well the idea is to check if GCP can detect and ignore an attack launched internally. In this case it should be secure enough to prevent from outsiders as well. The research investigation would involve Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks against a local virtual machine (VM) launched from GCP. There is a broad spectrum of VM's available in GCP compute engine service.","","978-1-7281-5584-5","10.1109/CSCI49370.2019.00269","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9070899","Cloud, Google Cloud Platform, Virtual Machine, Security, DoS/DDoS","Cloud computing;Servers;Computer crime;Virtual machining;Microsoft Windows;Google;Engines","cloud computing;computer network security;storage management;virtual machines","public service provider;GCP compute engine service;Google cloud platform;public cloud;sensitive data;storage services;computing services;cloud providers;vulnerability scanning;inside attackers;Distributed Denial of Service attacks;DDoS attack;virtual machine","","","8","","20 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed research involves an optimized SVM classification algorithm integrated with SNORT IPS to provide prevention mechanisms for the entire network when subject to DDoS attack. The proposed IPS method allows traffic identified as legitimate to pass through the network, whereas suspect traffic is flagged and has to go through an identification system.

Inspired by the success of machine learning in a variety of fields and domain applications, numerous intelligent schemes have been proposed to effectively defend against and mitigate the impact of these attacks. Traditional machine learning methods, however, are limited by the use of an expensive and error-prone feature engineering process. Feature engineering is fundamental to the application of machine learning, and is both difficult and expensive. Furthermore, the ability of these schemes to successfully detect previously unknown attacks is limited. To address these limitations, a novel DDoS detection scheme, based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), is proposed. The basic tenet of the LSTM scheme is its ability to distinguish between attack and legitimate flows by only examining a relatively small number of a network flow packets. The performance evaluation results show that the LSTM-based scheme successfully learns the complex flow-level feature representations embedded in raw input traffic. Furthermore, the results show that the scheme performs better than other approaches that use sophisticated flow-level statistical features. Lastly, the results show the ability of the proposed scheme to accurately capture the dynamic behaviors of unknown network traffic exceeds that of traditional machine learning methods.","2576-6813","978-1-7281-0962-6","10.1109/GLOBECOM38437.2019.9013450","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9013450","","Computer crime;Machine learning;Feature extraction;Botnet;Training;Recurrent neural networks;Intrusion detection","","","","2","25","","27 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Studies have shown that an SDN may experience a high packet loss rate and a long delay in forwarding messages when the OpenFlow channel is overwhelmed by a saturation attack. The existing approaches have focused on the detection of saturation attacks caused by TCP-SYN flooding through periodic analysis of network traffic. However, there are two issues. First, previous approaches are incapable of detecting other types, especially unknown types, of saturation attacks. Second, they rely on predetermined time-window of network traffic and thus are unable to determine what time window of traffic data would be appropriate for effective attack detection. To tackle these problems, this paper first investigates the impact of different time-windows of OpenFlow traffic on the detection performance of three classification algorithms: the Support Vector Machine (SVM), the Naïve Bayes (NB) classifier, and the K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) classifier. We have built and analyzed a total of 150 models on OpenFlow traffic datasets generated from both physical and simulated SDN environments. The experiment results show that the chosen time-interval of OpenFlow traffic heavily influences the detection performance - larger time-windows may result in decreased detection performance. In addition, we were able to achieve reasonable accuracy on detection of unknown attacks by applying proper time-windows of OpenFlow traffic.","","978-1-7281-0875-9","10.1109/CCCS.2019.8888049","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8888049","Software-defined networking;OpenFlow;saturation attack;anomaly detection;machine learning","Floods;Computer crime;Support vector machines;Machine learning;Training;Telecommunication traffic;Control systems","computer network management;computer network security;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;software defined networking;support vector machines;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","data plane;high packet loss rate;saturation attack;network traffic;predetermined time-window;effective attack detection;OpenFlow traffic datasets;physical SDN environments;simulated SDN environments;detection performance;Software Defined Networking;network paradigm;network management;support vector machine;SVM;Naïve Bayes classifier;K-Nearest Neighbors classifier;machine learning","","2","27","","31 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The challenge of DDoS detection is the combination of attack approaches coupled with the volume of live traffic to be analysed. In this paper, we present a practical, lightweight deep learning DDoS detection system called Lucid, which exploits the properties of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify traffic flows as either malicious or benign. We make four main contributions; (1) an innovative application of a CNN to detect DDoS traffic with low processing overhead, (2) a dataset-agnostic preprocessing mechanism to produce traffic observations for online attack detection, (3) an activation analysis to explain Lucid's DDoS classification, and (4) an empirical validation of the solution on a resource-constrained hardware platform. Using the latest datasets, Lucid matches existing state-of-the-art detection accuracy whilst presenting a 40x reduction in processing time, as compared to the state-of-the-art.

The ease of making DDoS attacks has led to an increase of these attacks in network traffic. In contrast, the method of non-machine learning Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is now seen very inaccurate. There is a need then for an IDS method with machine learning (ML) that is more accurate in detecting attacks. Several previous studies have known that the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Decision Tree (DT) algorithms are two algorithms with high accuracy in detecting DDoS attacks. However, research comparing the two algorithms is not found so far. In this study, a comparative analysis was carried out between the two algorithms. The result of this study showed that DT had a higher accuracy with an accuracy value of 99.91% than KNN which only had an accuracy value of 98.94% in detecting DDoS attacks.","","978-1-7281-6142-6","10.1109/ICoICT49345.2020.9166380","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9166380","DDoS;KNN;Decision Tree","Computer crime;Decision trees;Classification algorithms;Feature extraction;Data models;Machine learning algorithms;Machine learning","computer network security;decision trees;learning (artificial intelligence)","distributed denial of service attacks;nonmachine learning Intrusion Detection System;IDS method;machine learning;K-Nearest Neighbor;Decision Tree algorithms;DDoS attacks;comparative analysis","","","10","","13 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nevertheless, attackers might silently eavesdrop packets to crack sensitive information or launch cyberattacks to damage the network performance of victims. In this paper, we propose a learning based adaptive network immune mechanism (LANIM) to prevent the eavesdropping attacks. Specifically, LANIM is equipped with three defense lines and one constraint. The first defense line focuses on making decisions about abnormal network conditions by the minimum risk machine learning algorithms. The second defense line is the encryption strategy which focuses on the intent and application. The programmable devices implement novel policies such as multipath transmission and packet encapsulation. LANIM inherits the existing countermeasures based on computational complexity, which is the third defense line. Besides, the policy dynamically updates with random seeds is the constraint of the cyberattack. The attackers have to conquer these three immune lines before the new policy update otherwise the offensive is shattered. We implement LANIM with the P4 language and the Smart Identifier Network (SINET) framework, evaluate the ability to resist the hazards of eavesdropping attacks and explore the trade-offs between security and performance.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2956805","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8918023","Machine learning;security and performance trade-offs;adaptive network immune mechanism;eavesdropping attacks;SINET","Eavesdropping;Encryption;Protocols;Adaptive systems;Network architecture","computational complexity;computer crime;computer network security;cryptography;data privacy;Internet;learning (artificial intelligence)","computational complexity;minimum risk machine learning algorithms;P4 language;SINET;cyber attack;learning based adaptive network immune mechanism;packet encapsulation;multipath transmission;defense line;encryption mechanisms;defense eavesdropping attacks;Smart Identifier Network framework;LANIM","","","32","CCBY","29 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recent studies have shown that there exist various security threats in SDN. For example, a saturation attack may disturb the normal delivery of packets and even make the SDN system out of service by flooding the data plane, the control plane, or both. The existing research has focused on saturation attacks caused by SYN flooding. This paper presents an anomaly detection method, called SA-Detector, for dealing with a family of saturation attacks through IP spoofing, ICMP flooding, UDP flooding, and other types of TCP flooding, in addition to SYN flooding. SA-Detector builds upon the study of self-similarity characteristics of OpenFlow traffic between the control and data planes. Our work has shown that the normal and abnormal traffic flows through the OpenFlow communication channel have different statistical properties. Specifically, normal OpenFlow traffic has a low self-similarity degree whereas the occurrences of saturation attacks typically imply a higher degree of self-similarity. Therefore, SA-Detector exploits statistical results and self-similarity degrees of OpenFlow traffic, measured by Hurst exponents, for anomaly detection. We have evaluated our approach in both physical and simulation SDN environments with various time intervals, network topologies and applications, Internet protocols, and traffic generation tools. For the physical SDN environment, the average accuracy of detection is 97.68% and the average precision is 94.67%. For the simulation environment, the average accuracy is 96.54% and the average precision is 92.06%. In addition, we have compared SA-Detector with the existing saturation attack detection methods in terms of the aforementioned performance metrics and controller's CPU utilization. The experiment results indicate that SA-Detector is effective for the detection of saturation attacks in SDN.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2019.2959268","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8932535","Software-defined networking;security;saturation attack;anomaly detection;self-similar characteristic of OpenFlow traffic","Control systems;Anomaly detection;Protocols;Monitoring;Intrusion detection;Network topology","computer network security;software defined networking;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","normal OpenFlow traffic;SA-Detector;SDN environments;control plane;data plane;SYN flooding;ICMP flooding;UDP flooding;TCP flooding;abnormal traffic;saturation attack detection methods;Hurst exponents;self-similarity degrees;traffic generation tools","","2","31","IEEE","13 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is one that uses multiple network resources as the source of the attack. Depending on the nature of the learning, machine‐learning algorithms can be categorized as: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. The chapter summarizes the machine‐learning algorithms that could be used for various use cases for different domains. There are multiple issues with a cloud‐only architecture where data from IoT devices make it to the cloud to be processed and analyzed.

The proposed architecture is composed of a traditional CNN and a fundamental error term in view of the convergence of the backpropagation algorithm.
